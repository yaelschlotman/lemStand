         <h1>Welcome to Your Ghetto Lemonade Stand</h1>
        	<h3>It's been a hot summer.  You're dying to hit the beach, but you're broke and have to stay home, running through the sprinklers to stay cool.</p>
                <br>After checking all your pockets and under all the cushions, you managed to gather a whopping 98 cents.</br>
                <br>That won't get you across the street, let alone bus fare across town, but you've got a plan.</br>
                <br>The owner of the corner store will sell to you wholesale for 2 cents per cup.</br>
                <br>Now you're in business.</br>
                <br>You need to set your price above your cost and sell enough to make a profit.</br>
        		<br>The temperature and how the weather is will make a difference how many people stop by.</br>
        		<br>How you set your price, depending on the weather, will make a difference whether they decide to buy.</br>
        		<br>Check the weather so you can buy enough supplies and set your prices wisely.</br></h3>
        <h2>Good luck!
